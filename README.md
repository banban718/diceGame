## Service Requirement
- [x] Create multi-user service based dice-rolling game
- [x] Incorporate data persistence
- [x] Create both the service and simple front end
- [x] Only a minimal amount of data should be stored on the client

## Game Requirements
- [x] See high scores for all users 
- [x] See your high score
- [x] Rolling: 1.) Rolls should be done on the server side 2.) The front end should display your results

## Delivery
- [x] Create a public Github
- [x] Provide the link to the repo: https://github.com/banchecky/diceGame
- [x] Provide a working demo link (deployed to a free tier AWS, Heroku, etc): https://squid-game-dice.herokuapp.com/

## Optional Challenges
- [x] Automated tests (Cypress)
- [ ] Different numbers of dice and high scores for each quantity
- [ ] Different types of dice (4,6,8,10,12,20, etc sided)
- [ ] High score of the day
- [ ] More robust user registration and storage
- [x] A nice UI/UX for rolling the dice, highscores, and user data
- [ ] Anything else you would like to show us!




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Runs E2E Cypress tests

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
